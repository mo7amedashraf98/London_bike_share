# London_bike_share
* A project where I leveraged my Python skills to explore, manipulate, preprocess the data to clean and prepare it for the visualization phase. Have a look at the python script [HERE](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1fQ7ET1uVJ9E72wblI6qfObMYgrIq6sAs?usp=drive_link)


* Then used Tableau to create an interactive dashboard to show the London bike rides at any given time by the user. Have a look at the dashboard [HERE](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/mohamed.ashraf6203/viz/LondonBikeRidesVizualization/Dashboard1)
